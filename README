# Milestone 1 (My Portfolio)

Welcome, my name is Wilson Mendes.

As a student of the Level 5 Diploma in Web Development, I will be building my first portfolio using HTML and CSS, along with web tools like Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Favicon and Google Fonts. I will also leverage the resources from the Code Institute to guide me through the process.

## The project idea:

- Build my first portfolio to be used as practice for my future portfolio wedsite.

## Use of the project:

- To be use for my personal development and enrichement in how to build a front-end website.

## Porpose:

- As the first milestone, I'll put all the knowledge that been given and try to create a engaging and attractive webpage for my portfolio.

## Information while building this project:

1. This project was originally created under a different name (https://github.com/Wald13/Project-1.git). Unfortunately, while moving from Gitpod to VS Code, unexpected errors occurred. As a result, the first commits were copied and pasted from the previous project, along with what I could salvage from it.

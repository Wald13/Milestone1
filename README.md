# üöÄ Milestone 1 Portfolio: Wilson Mendes
Welcome! I'm Wilson Mendes, a student in the Level 5 Diploma in Web Development. This repository contains my first portfolio project, serving as a foundational milestone to demonstrate and solidify my front-end development skills.

## ‚ú® Project Goal & Purpose
### This portfolio project had two primary objectives:

Fundamental Practice: To serve as a practical exercise in building an attractive and engaging single-page website, putting all foundational knowledge into practice.

Future Foundation: To establish a strong, clean code base and design structure that will inform and be scaled up into my future professional portfolio.

## üéØ Key Features
The website is designed to be fully responsive and user-friendly across all devices.

Professional Layout: Clean, modern design built using the Bootstrap 5 grid system.

Intuitive Navigation: A clear, consistent navigation bar for easy access to the Home, Experience, and Contact sections.

Aesthetic Typography: Enhanced readability and design provided by Google Fonts.

Iconography: Use of Font Awesome to provide visual cues and modern flair.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Development History
This project was originally initiated under a different repository name (https://github.com/Wald13/Project-1.git). Due to technical issues encountered while migrating the project environment from Gitpod to VS Code, some unexpected errors occurred. As a result, the initial commits in this repository are a direct copy of the functional code that was salvaged from the previous project.
